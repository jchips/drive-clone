# Drive Clone

## Description

A Google Drive clone web app inspired by [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/c/webdevsimplified).

Web Dev Simplified made this same project in 2021 but Firebase documentation has changed since then so I wrote the project so that it works using the up-to-date documentation.

## Author: Jelani R

## Architecture

This web app is built in React and uses: Firebase Auth, Cloud Firestore, Firebase Storage, Bootstrap/React Bootstrap.

Languages used: JavaScript/JSX and SCSS.
